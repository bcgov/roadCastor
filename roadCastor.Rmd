# Overview

The roading module simulates the development of future roads within a landscape object. Based on a user defined set of points or 'landings' the roading module connects these points to the nearest existing road section using one of three possible approaches:
1. A snapping approach that simulates the road as the crow flies;
2. A least cost path that simulates as the wolf runs; and
3. A minimum spanning tree with least cost paths to promote branching

For a comparison on these approaches go [here](https://github.com/bcgov/castor/blob/master/reports/roads/draft-CLUS-roads.md)


# Usage

```{r module_usage}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
source(here::here("R/functions/R_Postgres.R"))

moduleDir <- paste0(here::here(),"/R/SpaDES-modules")
